Leex is the missing piece of yecc in Erlang. It allows you to tokenize a textual input stream so that it can be grammatically analyzed and processed by yecc. It is NOT a part of OTP at this point.

The source code included in this distribution was downloaded from http://forum.trapexit.org/viewtopic.php?p=43924#43924 where Robert Virding first made it available to the public.
